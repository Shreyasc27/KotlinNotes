# Section 3: Basic Differences Between Kotlin and Java

### 16. Hello World from Kotlin

`In Kotlin, it is possible to write code that is outside the class.`

`REPL` - Read Eval Print Loop

When compiling the Kotlin programs, `Kotlin compiler` compiles that `.kt` files in `byte code` ie `.class` files

Java : Java Runtime Library
Kotlin : Kotlin Runtime Library

In Kotlin, methods can be created independent of classes.
When the code is compiled, Kotlin compiler adds classes to the methods.

Functions defined out classes are called `Top Level Functions`

### 17. The Kotlin Standard Library

Kotlin imports whole lot of stuff be default into every Kotlin file.

Kotling Standard Library serves the same purpose as what the JDK does.

While distributing the Kotlin application, also have to distribute the Kotlin Runtime.

### 18. Variable Declarations in Kotlin

Kotlin uses `Type Inference`. Compiler can usually figure out or infer the type of the variable based on the context in which you are using it.
This happens at Compile time and not at Run time.
Kotlin is a statically type language.

`val` - Declaration is Immutable. Equivalent to final in Java. Recommended in Kotlin.
For immutable variables, it is possible to change the value of the instance properties.

### 19. How to Create Type Aliases in Kotlin

Kotlin Aliases - They help you use another name for the existing type.
e.g.
`typealias EmployeeSet = Set<Employee>`
`var employees : EmployeeSet`
Prevents the effort of writing `Set<Employee>` everytime.

### 20. Quick Differences Between Kotlin and Java

* Dont have to put Semicolons at the end of the statement.
* Kotlin has Wrappers. `println` is a Kotlin wrapper around Java's `System.out.println`
* Hard and Soft Keywords
* [] Square brackets can be used to access elements in the collection. e.g. println(names[1])
* Kotlin has its own String class. Kotlin does not use java.lang.String.
* Kotlin does not distinguish between Checked and UnChecked Exception. throws keyword does not exist in Kotlin. All exceptions are UnChecked.
* Kotlin does not have Terniary Operator. It is replaced with If. If is an expression in Kotlin.
* Java like for loops i.e. for(i=0; i<10; i++) does not exist in Kotlin.
* Kotlin does not have a static keyword. But concept of static is still there.
* Kotlin does not have `new` keyword. e.g. `var employee1 = Employee("Priyanka Chaudhary", 111)`

### 21. How Kotlin handles equality differently from Java

In Java, 
* `==` operator looks for `Referential Equality`
* `equals` operator looks for `Structural Equality`

In Kotlin,
* `==` operator looks for `Structural Equality` 
* `===` operator looks for `Referntial Equality` 

* For checking if both the instances have the same value use the `==` operator.
* For checking if both the instances refer to the same instance use the `===` operator.

### 22. Bit Operators and Smart Casting in Kotlin

`Smart Casting`

Java :: `instanceOf`
Kotlin :: `is` & `as`

```
    val name: Any = "The Any type is the root of the Kotlin Type Hierarchy"

    if(name is String){
        println("Uppercase string : ${name.toUpperCase()}")
    }
```

### 23. String Templates in Kotlin

`String Templates`

val change = 4.22
* println("$change")
`O/P - 4.22`
* println("\\$change")
`O/P - $change`
* println("$$change")
`O/P - $4.22`

val numerator = 10.11
val denominator = 20.22
* `O/P - println("$numerator divided by $ denominator is ${numerator/denominator}")`

Printing object properties
* `O/P - println("Employee One is ${employeeone.id}")`

### 24. Raw Strings in Kotlin

`Raw Strings or Triple Quoted Strings`
* `String filePath = "C:\\SHREYAS\\2.Git"` OR `String filePath = """C:\SHREYAS\2.Git"""`
* Triple Quoted String
```
println("""   1
        |  11
        | 111
        |1111
    """.trimMargin())
```
No need of new line characters.
* `trimMargin("|")` - For proper indentation in the code
* The `Any type` is the root of the Kotlin Type Hierarchy

### 25. The Kotlin REPL

`REPL` - [R]ead [E]val [P]rint [L]oop
