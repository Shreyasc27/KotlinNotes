# Section 2 : Introduction to Kotlin

### 11. Introduction to Kotlin

`Statically Typed` - Value of every expression is determined at compile time.

`Functional Programming`  
Store functions as values meaning -
* Can store them in variables
* Can return them from functions
* Can pass them as arguments to functions
Declare immutable objects i.e. instances that cannot be changed

`Kotlin guiding principles` 
* Safety - Gets long lenghts to prevent NullPointerException. Can get NullPointerExcetpion. But have to go great lengths.
* Interoperability - Works with Java. The best of both the worlds. Kotlin is Interoperable with Java.
