# Section 5 : OO And Kotlin : Classes, Functions, Inheritance

### 35. Access Modifier

* In Kotlin, `Functions` and `Properties` can be defined at the top level.
* 4 access modifiers -
    * public
    * private
    * protected
    * internal
    
##### Top-Level
   
* If no access modifier is specified, then declaration is `Public`.
* `Default visibility is Public`
* If top level item is Private then everything within the same class can access it.
* Not necessary that the name of the file should name of the class in the file. So we can many `Public` classes in a single kotlin file.

* Classes can be `Private`. Everything within the same file can be accessed.

* `Module` - Group of files that are compiled together
* Top level item that is marked `Internal` can only be accessed inside a `Module`

* `Private` - Visible with the same file
* `Protected` - Can't be used
* `Public` - Visible everywhere
* `Internal` - Visible within the same module
