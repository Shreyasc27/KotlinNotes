# Section 5 : OO And Kotlin : Classes, Functions, Inheritance

### 35. Access Modifier

* In Kotlin, `Functions` and `Properties` can be defined at the top level.
* 4 access modifiers -
    * public
    * private
    * protected
    * internal
    
#### Top-Level
   
* If no access modifier is specified, then declaration is `Public`.
* `Default visibility is Public`
* If top level item is Private then everything within the same class can access it.
* Not necessary that the name of the file should name of the class in the file. So we can many `Public` classes in a single kotlin file.

* Classes can be `Private`. Everything within the same file can be accessed.

* `Module` - Group of files that are compiled together
* Top level item that is marked `Internal` can only be accessed inside a `Module`

* `Private` - Visible with the same file
* `Protected` - Can't be used
* `Public` - Visible everywhere
* `Internal` - Visible within the same module

#### Class Members
* Anything inside a `Module` that can see a `Class` can also see its `Internal Members`.

* In Kotlin, classes cannot see Private members belonging to Inner classes.

* When Kotlin files compile, the access modifiers have to be compiled to the modifiers that JVM understands.
    * `Private` is compiled to `Package Private`
    * `Internal` is compile to `Public`

* Kotlin inforces its visibility rules at Compile time.

### 36. Declaring Classes and USing Constructors in Kotlin

* All classes are `Public` & `Final` by default.
* Kotlin has a concept of `Primary Constructors` that can be defined outside the Curly braces.
* Once declared inside the Curly braces of the class are called as `Secondary Constructors`.
